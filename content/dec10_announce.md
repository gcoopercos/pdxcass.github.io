# Open forum

An open forum will be hosted by iovation to discuss the various tools and documentation used in the maintenance of Cassandra. This will be a rather unstructured meeting with beer/soda and some kind of food (probably sandwiches or pizza).

Anything from 'show & tell' to a good discussion is fair game for content.

## When: 

Tuesday, December 10th

## Where:

iovation
32nd floor of the US Bancorp Tower at 111 SW 5th (5th & Oak).
