Summary: Website announcement for pdxcass.org

# Moving to meetup

__Unless there is any interest, after Mar. 1 this pdxcass.org domain will not be updated any longer.__
Rather, all content related to any meetups will be on the meetup site: [Here](http://www.meetup.com/DataStax-Cassandra-Portland-Users)

# Motivation

When initially getting the Cassandra group together there were several mediums being used... Meetup, Google+, pdxcass.org,
etc... 

It just doesn't make sense to maintain all these efforts. Additionally, since people have been gravitating to the meetup
site itself, this seems to make the most sense as the other places (including this site) seem to have fallen out of favor.


# Issues?

If you have any issues with this please send me a message over at the meetup site.
